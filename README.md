# Mapping_GPS
Uses GPS to put markers at current location on google maps and labels markers with Google's GPS accuracy reading.

The accuracy readings and times are recorded in a .txt file that can be copied and/or exported from the app if the user pressed "SAVE" after finishing the session.

Note: you need to include a Google Maps API key in the googe_maps_api.xml file in place of "YOUR_KEY_HERE".
